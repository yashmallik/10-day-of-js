// Objective

// In this challenge, we learn about strings and exceptions. Check out the attached tutorials for more details.

// Task

// Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, s. You must perform the following actions:

// Try to reverse string  using the split, reverse, and join methods.
// If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's message on a new line.
// Print s on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.
// Input Format

// Locked stub code in the editor reads variable s from stdin and passes it to the function.
